                                present? Arent we all here, now, in the present? Technically, yes, but for so
                                many of us, we are only 10 percent here. We are really living in our minds. We
                                exist from day-to-day in a dream-like state where were not really connected to
                                the world around us, nor centered in our own body or being. Instead, were
                                preoccupied with memories of the past, churning thoughts and worries about the
                                future, and judgments and reactions to the few things we do see. Were literally
                                missing out on most our own lives, which leaves us feeling shallow, empty and
                                deeply unsettled. The great news is you can learn to be more present and
                                mindful. Here are 10 easy ways you can practice mindfulness in your daily life.
                                1. Eat mindfully. When you scoff down your meal on autopilot while distracted by
                                the television, computer or constant conversation, you miss out on the delicious
                                taste and smell of your food. Youre also less likely to feel satisfied and
                                nourished, because you missed out on the fact that you ate. It can be helpful to
                                remember this phrase: When you eat, eat. When you drink, drink. In other words,
                                dont attempt to do fifty other things when you sit down to a meal, coffee or
                                green juice. Simply focus all of your attention on what is in front of you. 2.

                                about, pay attention occasionally to the movement of your body and your
                                surroundings. Notice as your feet connect with and leave the ground. Feel your
                                muscles moving and supporting you. Observe what is going on around you -- the
